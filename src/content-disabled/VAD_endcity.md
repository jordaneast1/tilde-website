<h2> Virtual Art Department - End City </h2>
<h3> 2023-2024 </h3>
<p>
Role: ‘Virtual Art Director’

Directing a team of 3 Unreal Artists to assist in all stages of the film’s development using Unreal Engine 5. Collaborating with the Art Department, Story, Visual Effects, DoP, Greens, Set Decorating and Stunts, the VAD became central to decision making and broader planning of the film.

By end of production, responsibilities of the VAD included:



Ingesting and maintaining sets from the Art Department, ready to be scouted for whoever needed to understand the scene.
Building VFX extensions and eventually constructing the broader world map beyond the physical sets with the Production Designer in order to extend the vision above Concept Art.


Using the Virtual extensions on stage with Simulcam to visualise the world behind the sets on blue screen.


Storyboarding with the Director by taking snapshots of chess-piecing posed 3D models of the actors with the production specific lenses for more accurate shot guides.


Delivering the Unreal project to VFX vendors to accelerate their development of sets by providing a heavily reviewed and approved base model.


Laying out set builds within replicas of the sound stages at the studio to assist in planning the shoot schedule.


Building virtual replicas of hardware like cranes and motion bases as an aid to planning complex shots.
