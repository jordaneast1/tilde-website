<p>Situated in a parallel place, close to home we find a scene where a hyper-colour figure stands within ash and cinder. 

Being Mushroom acts as a digital homage to real and imagined possibilities of space, place and time - created as an invitation to delve into the wonder of our environment. 

In collaboration with Sydney based creatives Jordan East and Pat Younis, Being Mushroom employs emerging digital tools such as gaming engines, rigged virtual clay materials, surface texture mapping and live drawing simulations. Being Mushroom experiments with how ideas and processes combine to create computer art for the new world. 

Drawing the viewer in as a participant - the world of Being Mushroom mirrors Sydney from sunrise to sunset with the real-time constellations moving overhead throughout the night
