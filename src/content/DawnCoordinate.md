<p> The Dawn Coordinate (X,Y, Z) is a three-piece installation collection that offers different perspectives of a dynamic virtual world. Each piece acts like a window to its own unique view of a shared naturescape that sits below an ever-changing sky; simultaneously experiencing the cycles of day and weather from the inception of the world to any given point in the future. Separated by their perspectives, each work features a sweeping Australian-inspired vista that is designed to evolve over time with the presence of the viewer.

Using the latest video-game engine Unreal Engine 5, The Dawn Coordinate is the first persistent virtual NFT installation designed to elicit a familiar feeling of being out in nature, for spaces where access to the outdoors is difficult. Inspired by video games and digital art that share the same vision, the art is designed to be passive and slow paced rather than goal oriented and immediately rewarding.

The Dawn Coordinate was funded and supported by the Justin Millar Art Gallery, under the MH Carnegie Mint NFT Art Fellowship Award and Gallery.
