<h3>
Hope (Single) - released on 04 June 2021 (Eyegaze) 
</h3>

Jordan - When I first heard 'Hope' I immediately thought of humanity's curiosity for exploring space and the awesome imagery produced by teams of engineers and years of combined effort.  

Using a freely available dataset from NASA's Hi-Rise camera (orbiting Mars) as the source of information, I created a generative texture system in TouchDesigner which allowed me to scan through the imagery alongside the music in a reactionary way - creating an infinite flyover of a familiar yet non-existent planet.

 Pat: “I'm stoked to finally present Hope.  My representation of those beautiful processes where new things emerge and thrive after periods of decay. 

 I didn't really intentionally set out to make a hopeful track or anything. In fact, the idea of the track representing hope gradually came to be through the process of writing it. So when I built that section before the final climax part, I really wanted to express the idea of things falling apart and disintegrating before a new element grows out of it. I think that is my representation of hope. “

<h3>
Pat Carroll - Winds (Official Video)
</h3>

For ‘Winds’ I collaborated with Jack Single to create a colour palette and capture footage of fluid acrylic paint, to be used as the source for motion and colour. 

The clips were then fed into Houdini where Optical Flow and POP dynamics were used to extrude the footage into 3 dimensions.

Pat: “There is a concept in music called 'reduced listening', that describes the method of listening to a sound as pure sound, not thinking about what kind of object may have created it. We just hear it and observe it like some unknown object. There are so many interesting moments in the video where I start seeing things less as paint and more just as abstract forms, creating this valuable (but unintentional) link between the sound and image.”

<h3>Pat Carroll - Branching (Official Video)</h3>
Pat: "When I first spoke with Jordan about the clip, I wanted something that made a synthetic reproduction of a natural process. I was reading a sci-fi book (Recursion - Blake Crouch) and TV show (Devs - Alex Garland) at the time of writing the EP, which both involved the idea of characters jumping between different possible timelines, made possible by some super advanced technology. It was geeky as hell, but the idea stuck and influenced the way I thought about the composition of EP. I thought that the concept of branching/forking would be cool for Jordan to explore, and am so stoked with what he came up with! I think the slow growth of it is really special."

Jordan: "For ‘Branching’ I wanted to simulate a time-lapse of a plants lifecycle - the curves of the plant are guided by a simple L-system shape, with the algorithm choosing the path of least resistance to create the tree-like formation. Once the system was set up I could guide the plants growth and turbulence to match the intensity of the track."
