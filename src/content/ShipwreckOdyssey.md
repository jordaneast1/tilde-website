<p> Jordan was involved in the creation of interactive elements for ‘Shipwreck Odyssey’ -  a production put on by our good friends at Box Of Birds at the Sydney Maritime Museum

Jordan's involvement included creating interactive systems in UE5  including a fluid system (FluidNinja), interactive bubbles (Niagara) and integrating an interactive fish simulation (Niagara).
Interactivity was enabled using 6x FLIR cameras via a TouchDesigner Optical Flow patch.

<i>"Voyage beneath the turquoise waves and coral cays of Queensland’s Great Barrier Reef as the ghost ship Jenny Lind leads you on an adventure into the wild wonders and mysteries of our oceans.

Part theatre show - part playspace immersive installation, Shipwreck Odyssey combines live storytelling and performance with a state-of-the-art responsive projection playscape- inviting audiences to come alive to their love for our blue planet.

Shipwreck Odyssey was first presented at the Australian National Maritime Museum as part of 2023 Sydney Festival. We performed over 100 shows. </i>
