<h3> UE5. TouchOSC.</h3>
<p> Steam Signals is a mixed reality installation artwork that explores the parallels of text-based communication of the modern age and gesture based communication through virtual space.  Designed as an interactive experience, the installation has each participant react gesturally to the person before them through rotational controls that manipulate the joints of the arm in the foreground.  By setting two poses, the user creates a gesture that is adopted by both arms for the next participant to respond to once the foreground arm has reset.

Based in the psychology of messaging applications, Steam Signals is built to capture the particular quirk with interpretation that is found with text messaging; When left to assume tonality, one can make broad assumptions of what is trying to be said. Similarly, gestures can often lead to misinterpretation without proper context of the subject being addressed (excluding international Sign Languages that have extensive vocabularies). These quirks of communication are emblematic of the challenges we've faced through lockdown and are deep seeded in the roots of the technology we're adopting to overcome distance in the modern world. By identifying the issues found in our current virtual social systems, the aim is for Steam Signals to contribute to the conversation around the quality of life we have in our increasingly digital futures.
