<p> We were brought on by <a href='https://codeoncanvas.cc/projects/air-force-capability-visualisation'>Code on Canvas</a> and <a href='https://stopniak.com/'> Studio Stopniak</a> for the production of the Air Force Capability Visualisation project, as part of the Air & Space Power Conference 2022.


Our roles were to bring to fruition the large amounts of visual effects and animation required to bring to life a representation of future military tech.


The project was built in Unity for Multiplayer VR and AR for mobile devices.
