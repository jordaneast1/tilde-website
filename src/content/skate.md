<p> In 2019, Jordan worked on SKATE by Big hART - a commerical theatre production that brings the art of skateboarding to the stage through percussion, projection and performance. Big hART is an Arts for social change company that tackles disadvantage through projects such as SKATE that bring invisible stories foward in society.

The project was based in The Cutaway in Barangaroo - an epic space to work in for 2 months. My role as AV Systems Designer was to create the motion tracking system & interactive content for the show, designed in TouchDesigner. This included motion-tracked projections, projection mapping and audio-reactive content triggered from the microphones places on the skaters feet and throughout the set.
