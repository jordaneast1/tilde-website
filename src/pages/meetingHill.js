          Meeting Hill was created during lockdown in 2020, as a place to share music, panels, interviews with local artists and collectives, DJ sets and other selected audio pieces.
          Over the two week period, a program was broadcasted live over the internet via AzuraCast (a free online radio host), with Meeting Hill as the social and visual platform for the artists.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Meeting Hill was created utilizing various web technlogies such as Three.js, positional audio (WebAudio API) and AzuraCast, with the backend created with node.js and socket.io and hosted on DigitalOcean.
